[h1]FAQ[/h1]

[h1]Does the mod support X version?[/h1]
The mod currently supports version 1.30.

[h1]Does this mod require DLC?[/h1]
No. But the mod will use game features that are DLC-exclusive, so if you lack a DLC you may be missing content from the mod.

[h1]Why hasn't the mod been updated?[/h1]
The mod may lag behind game updates if I lack the time to update properly. Simply get your betas password from [url=https://accounts.paradoxplaza.com] Paradox Plaza [/url] and then go to Properties -> Betas in steam. From there, enter the password and select the currently supported version of EU4 from the dropdown list.

[h1]Why is the localization broken?[/h1]
The mod currently only supports English localization. Switch your game language to English when playing the mod.

[h1]Why hasn't X been added?[/h1]
Features added to the mod are at the discretion of the developer. If you want to increase the chances of your suggestion being added, add a clear and concise post in the suggestion thread or in our discord.
