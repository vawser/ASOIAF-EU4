 GOT_SK_RANDOM.3.option.b: "The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] takes advice from no one!"
 
 GOT_SK_RANDOM.4.title: "A Grand Burial"
 GOT_SK_RANDOM.4.desc: "A powerful minister at the Small Council has died due to old age. The death of this eminence has left a vacuum that the other factions are now seeking to fill.

The Hand of the King has approached the King asking for a second round of out-takes to allow more of this gifted generation to join the administration."
 GOT_SK_RANDOM.11.option.a: "Only the best are good enough."

 GOT_SK_RANDOM.12.title: "The Southern Elites"
 GOT_SK_RANDOM.12.desc: "For centuries the southern houses has been richer and more populous than the north.

In the past quotas have been used to ensure that some part of those who pass the citadel examinations originate from the north. Such quotas would, however, risk to undermine our entire system of merit as the guiding principle."
 GOT_SK_RANDOM.12.option.a: "We need better quotas!"

 GOT_SK_RANDOM.14.title: "Commanders Dishonored"

 GOT_SK_RANDOM.14.option.a: "Execute him!"

 GOT_SK_RANDOM.15.title: "Heir Lends an Ear"
 GOT_SK_RANDOM.15.desc: "We have noticed that the heir apparent has grown closer to certain courtiers and nobles who are known affiliates of the competing factions at court. There's a great fear that [Root.Heir.GetName] has come to strongly sympathize with political enemies of the royal throne. We could attempt to stop these friendships from growing, but having powerful friends in court can be a good thing for our [Root.Heir.GetHerHim] when he assumes the throne."
 GOT_SK_RANDOM.15.option.a: "[Root.Heir.GetName] must stay aloof of court politics."
 GOT_SK_RANDOM.15.option.b: "[Root.Heir.GetName] must find [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] own way."
 
 GOT_SK_RANDOM.16.title: "'If people have enough, can the ruler have too little?'"
 GOT_SK_RANDOM.16.desc: "Word has reached you that a truly exceptional essay has passed through the Citadel. It argues convincingly and in excellent literary style that it is folly to expect a country to be rich from increasing taxes. Our examiners describe this text as 'profoundly crafted' and there is no doubt that it will give rise to a new style for examination essays for years to come.\nThe meat of the essay itself, however, cannot be ignored. The argument that avoiding high taxes makes the people as a whole richer and therefore the kingdom itself richer is a classical wisdom it is easy to overlook."
 GOT_SK_RANDOM.16.option.a: "I sense a great future for this man."
 GOT_SK_RANDOM.16.option.b: "We must stay clear of such dangerous influence!"
 
 GOT_SK_RANDOM.17.title: "Maester Publishes"

 GOT_SK_RANDOM.18.title: "Servant Flogged"
 GOT_SK_RANDOM.18.desc: "A high ranking noble has earned himself a reputation for cruelty since taking to regularly flogging a particular servant of his, of whom he seems to have a particular distaste.

 GOT_SK_RANDOM.18.option.a: "He's setting an excellent example!"
 GOT_SK_RANDOM.18.option.b: "Relieve the Noble."
 
 GOT_SK_RANDOM.19.title: "Drama on the Trident"
 GOT_SK_RANDOM.19.desc: "A Trident River tax barge, containing a significant share of this year's taxes from the riverland provinces, has been boarded and seized by criminals.

 GOT_SK_RANDOM.20.title: "Gold Mine Discovered"

 GOT_SK_RANDOM.21.title: "Bullion Leaves the Country"
 GOT_SK_RANDOM.21.desc: "It has been discovered that large amounts of silver bullion have left the country on the various trade barges.

 GOT_SK_RANDOM.22.title: "Renovating a Sept"
 GOT_SK_RANDOM.22.desc: "An old sept in one of our provinces has fallen into disrepair after several years of neglected maintenance. A local noble has now requested funds to restore the sept."

 GOT_SK_RANDOM.22.option.b: "We have no time for such nonsense."
 
 GOT_SK_RANDOM.23.title: "Frontier Hero"
 GOT_SK_RANDOM.23.desc: "Word has reached us from the frontier provinces of a young general from one of our most influential families. The young man has made a name for himself as an excellent warrior and a great leader. His success has also made his family grow ever more influential at court.\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] is growing more and more fearful of their influence in court politics."
 GOT_SK_RANDOM.23.option.a: "Charge the Noble with Corruption."
 GOT_SK_RANDOM.23.option.b: "We must replace him and distance ourselves from that family."
 GOT_SK_RANDOM.23.option.c: "We cannot touch this hero of the people!"
 
 GOT_SK_RANDOM.24.title: "'Maesters by Purchase'"
 GOT_SK_RANDOM.24.desc: "Many would give much to be able to attend the Citadel. To some rich families, this would be a way to ensure that their children acquire the social status that their wealth should entitle them to. It has therefore been the custom to, in times of need, reserve a number of spots at the Citadel for those that can pay.\nMost will never take advantage of the actual opportunity to study, however, as admission in itself is enough to secure higher social standing."
 GOT_SK_RANDOM.24.option.a: "Just a few additional reserved spots can surely do no harm?"
 GOT_SK_RANDOM.24.option.b: "We must not risk the quality of our bureaucrats!"
 
 GOT_SK_RANDOM.25.title: "Rogue Diplomacy"
 GOT_SK_RANDOM.25.desc: "Advisers led by the Master of Ships have been very active in foreign diplomacy lately. [country_of_interest.GetName] in particular occupies the faction's attention. They believe opening up more channels for trade and cooperation would be beneficial for both of our countries. Some would rather argue that [country_of_interest.GetName] should submit to the authority of the Iron Throne.\nThe foreign ambassador has been summoned to the royal palace. What shall we tell him?"
 GOT_SK_RANDOM.25.option.a: "That he may go in peace."
 GOT_SK_RANDOM.25.option.b: "That he best prepare his defenses."
 
 GOT_SK_RANDOM.26.title: "The Favor of [Root.Monarch.GetName]"
 GOT_SK_RANDOM.26.desc: "Court nobles are worried that [Root.Monarch.GetName] is being unduly influenced by [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] consorts. As members of prominent families of the realm they all have an interest in the power that comes from being near [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] Royal majesty.\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself], however, see no risk in this, it is merely natural that everyone seek the favor of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]."

 GOT_SK_RANDOM.27.title: "Royal Insults"
 GOT_SK_RANDOM.27.desc: "Today the reception of foreign dignitaries and potentates to the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ court, has caused a diplomatic blunder. Contrary to protocol a foreign diplomat failed to perform the customary bow before our representatives. This major loss of face has quickly developed into a scandal and threatens to hurt our relations with [country_of_interest.GetName] for some time to come. The ambassador is now offering us valuable gifts to forget the affair."

 GOT_SK_RANDOM.28.title: "Inspecting The Great Houses"
 GOT_SK_RANDOM.28.desc: "The armies from the Great Houses have amassed on the exercise field for inspection. Everywhere you look there is a forest of spears and swords, aiming in defiance at the heavens above. Several powerful nobles are present. Over the past few years these men have done everything in their power to strengthen the army.\nThe safety of the Iron Throne depends on these troops, but it is not unheard of for a strong noble to covet the throne himself..."
 GOT_SK_RANDOM.28.option.a: "Commend the nobles for their work"
 GOT_SK_RANDOM.28.option.b: "It is time we weakened their forces."
 
 GOT_SK_RANDOM.29.title: "Failures of the Citadel"
 GOT_SK_RANDOM.29.desc: "As the research at the Citadel is refuted once again only a few hundreds of the thousands that participate will pass. This elite of experienced maesters will join the administration to rule the Seven Kingdoms in accordance with the traditional ideals.\nThe many that fail, however, have to find work elsewhere. Far from illiterate they are still carriers of the traditional ideals and education that their research requires. These are the doctors, teachers and scribes of the kingdom. Some might say they are as valuable as the erudite few who join the cadres in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName]"
 GOT_SK_RANDOM.29.option.a: "Everything has beauty, but not everyone sees it."
 GOT_SK_RANDOM.29.option.b: "All good and well but perhaps we should expand the quota for next year?"
 
 GOT_SK_RANDOM.30.title: "Examining the Citadel"
 GOT_SK_RANDOM.30.desc: "There are those who feel the Citadel are not in tune with what is good and proper research and that the ideal they promote is stale and old fashioned. Among those researching are alternative collections of research, which have begun circulating what is considered a more modern form. The head masters, however, are determined to keep promoting good taste and proper form.\nBy supporting the renewal faction we would bring a generation of new thinkers to the fore. This would likely come at the cost of the goodwill and loyalty of the old generation..."
 GOT_SK_RANDOM.30.option.a: "Learning without thought is labor lost, thought without learning is perilous."
 GOT_SK_RANDOM.30.option.a.tt:0 "Act to ensure the continuity of the existing system and the preferences of the Citadel."

 GOT_SK_RANDOM.31.desc: "[From.From.GetName] has fallen and the [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] dynasty is now believed to be the new holders of the Iron Throne. We are expected to pick up the mantle of the King and bring the Westerosi people into a new era of prosperity and stability.\nIf we want to win over the remaining supporters of [From.From.GetName] rule we must start to build our own Royal bureaucracy and invest in a strong and durable state. On the other hand [Root.Monarch.GetName] worries that disloyal nobles will remain within any organization we inherit from [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] predecessors."
 GOT_SK_RANDOM.31.option.a: "We must be merciful if we are to build something lasting."
 GOT_SK_RANDOM.31.option.b: "Purge any remaining loyalists!"

 GOT_SK_RANDOM.32.desc: "[Root.Monarch.GetTitle], your reign has ushered in a new era and as the [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] complete their take-over the Seven Kingdoms will undoubtedly prosper for many years to come. Perhaps the time has come to look back to the [From.From.GetName] empire and start the compilation of their history. Compiling a the fortunes of the Seven Kingdoms during their entire reign would cost a fair bit of money and take many bureaucrats quite some time, but the benefits might outweigh the costs."
 GOT_SK_RANDOM.32.option.a: "Time is of the essence!"
 GOT_SK_RANDOM.32.option.b: "A thorough work for a solid rule."
 
 GOT_SK_RANDOM.35.title: "Protecting the Wall"
 GOT_SK_RANDOM.35.desc: "A strong army has always been required to secure the Wall in the North. In times of weakness the wildlings in the regions outside of our reach have never hesitated to raid or even invade our lands.\nTo ensure our safety the northern nobles are asking to send expeditions into the far north, probing the strength of the wildlings while also demonstrating our might."
 GOT_SK_RANDOM.35.option.a: "An excellent idea!"
 GOT_SK_RANDOM.35.option.b: "We must strengthen our defenses instead."
 
 GOT_SK_RANDOM.36.title: "Pre-Andal Statuette"
 GOT_SK_RANDOM.36.desc: "A rare statuette from the Pre-Andal era has been discovered during renovations of an old sept. The idea has crossed your mind that it might be clever to bestow the statuette upon a worthy subject to strengthen his loyalty to you, The King. Loyalties will doubtlessly change on account of such an impressive gift delivered directly from the King's own hand. Who shall we give it to?"
 GOT_SK_RANDOM.36.option.a: "The Hand of the King."
 GOT_SK_RANDOM.36.option.b: "The Most Influential Family."

 GOT_SK_RANDOM.39.title: "Withdrawing Excess Paper"
 GOT_SK_RANDOM.39.desc: "There is general consensus within the Royal Court that the amount of fiduciary media in circulation is much too great. Money must be recalled in order for inflation to recede from its current level, but the question is how much money should be rebought."
 GOT_SK_RANDOM.39.option.a: "As much as we can afford."

 GOT_SK_RANDOM.42.title: "Court Bickering"
 GOT_SK_RANDOM.42.desc: "One of your Commanders has been insulted by a high ranking official of the Hand of the King. Apparently the men have had a hard time getting along for quite some time, and the insult was probably not entirely unprovoked. Nevertheless, the matter has become a pivot point of factional politics at the court, and it might be wise if the Emperor himself gave some input on the issue."
 GOT_SK_RANDOM.42.option.a: "Relieve the Hand of the King of his duties."
 GOT_SK_RANDOM.42.option.b: "Relieve the Lord Commander of his duties."

 GOT_SK_RANDOM.45.title: "Rise of Militias"
 GOT_SK_RANDOM.45.desc: "Our weakening grip over the kingdom and the increasingly popular notion that we are losing royal authority has given rise to a variety of militia movements around the country. What they have in common is the goal of disruption chaos and the overthrowing of our established and perceived oppressive rule."
 GOT_SK_RANDOM.45.option.a: "What can they do against the might of the Kingdom?"
 GOT_SK_RANDOM.45.option.b: "We must act decisively to stomp this out!"
 
 GOT_SK_RANDOM.46.title: "Floods"
 GOT_SK_RANDOM.46.desc: "The Seasonal rains have hit us unusually hard this year. As the Blackwater River levees break and homes are washed away the sky itself seems to be weeping for our dynasty. In the provinces rumors have begun to circulate that this catastrophe is a sign of the loss of royal authority and the iminent collapse of the Kingdom."
 GOT_SK_RANDOM.46.option.a: "It is our duty to restore what we can."

 GOT_SK_RANDOM.47.option.b: "Let them fend for themselves."
 
 GOT_SK_RANDOM.48.title: "The Shadow that Stalks the Corridor"
 GOT_SK_RANDOM.48.desc: "As you walk through the long corridors of the Red Keep, you suddenly have a distinct sense of being followed. In the corner of your eye a black-clad man approaches you from behind. You cannot see the dagger, gleaming with malice, but you know it is there, behind you, a mere few yards from your heart.\nAs you turn around the man is suddenly gone without a trace. It is as if he was never there..."

 GOT_SK_RANDOM.49.desc: "You can only stare in awe as the glowing red comet streaks across the sky. You are shaken by the experience, but many of your subjects are absolutely terrified.

 GOT_SK_RANDOM.50.title: "Disloyal Officials"
 GOT_SK_RANDOM.50.desc: "The Citadel is excellent for turning out well educated and thoroughly competent maesters, ready to face the various challenges of day to day rule and administration that the Seven Kingdoms possess.\nThat same education is, however, now making our administrators very weary of some of the measures we have been taking recently. Believing the [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] family to be acting without a just cause has made many officials unwilling to comply with our demand. At times it would seem royal authority doesn't stretch further than one can see from the palace walls."
 GOT_SK_RANDOM.50.option.a: "We must purge such heresy!"
 GOT_SK_RANDOM.50.option.b: "In time we will earn their trust again."

 GOT_SK_RANDOM.51.desc: "It is becoming more and more apparent that the power of the [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] is waning and that the royal center is unable to rule the Crownlands, much less maintain any kind of authority over the outer lands.\nWith the refusal of the [unruly_subject.GetAdjective] to kowtow before what they believe to be an illegitimate king it seems our influence beyond our borders has deteriorated sharply."
 GOT_SK_RANDOM.51.option.a: "Fear will keep them in line!"
 
 GOT_SK_RANDOM.52.title: "Plague Strikes The Court"
 GOT_SK_RANDOM.52.desc: "Plagues, famines, droughts and calamities are becoming increasingly frequent in $COUNTRY$ these days, and now a particularly nasty disease has arrived at court. Yesterday morning a Bureaucrat employed by the Hand of the King was found dead after having complained of a sore throat the day before. The disease is now spreading throughout the court, and several more are already showing symptoms. Royal authority is no longer with us, it would appear."
 GOT_SK_RANDOM.52.option.a: "Flee to a countryside province."
 GOT_SK_RANDOM.52.option.b: "We shall all remain in the capital."
 
 GOT_SK_RANDOM.53.title: "Daggers in the Dark"
 GOT_SK_RANDOM.53.desc: "A scream echoes through the palace, but soon dissolves again into the silence and black of the night. A courtier has been murdered, found in his bedchamber with a blade buried deep in his back, and several stab wounds to the rest of his body.

 GOT_SK_RANDOM.54.desc: "For the past nine months you have been an expecting father, and today one of your concubines did indeed give birth to a son. The joy is cut short, however, when the child is brought before you. His face is deformed into what looks like a permanent scream, and soft, black fur-like hair grows in patches over his little body. The child is misshapen, and your physician suspects that the deformity has affected his mental capacities as well. Some claim that this disaster proves that we no longer enjoy royal authority."

 GOT_SK_RANDOM.56.title: "Flawed Insights"
 GOT_SK_RANDOM.56.desc: "The Hand of the King has recently delivered their reports on the past years' advancements within their respective areas of expertise, and there is dire news. One of the advisers has significantly lowered their estimates of the rate of future progress, and the faction responsible for that department is bound to lose a great deal of face over the event. These news come at a time when it is becoming increasingly more evident that we no longer enjoy royal authority.\nWhich adviser mismanaged their people?"

 GOT_SK_RANDOM.58.desc: "Queer noises have been coming from the room of the Grand Maester during the night lately, increasing in intensity and strength with each passing month. Initially you put it down to some intricate playtime with one of his concubines, but recently it has begun to dawn on you that there is a remarkable connection between the lunar phase and the noises. A spy sent into the garden on a full moon night returns with disturbing news: The Grand Secretary spends his nights standing in his garden, howling at the moon."

 GOT_SK_RANDOM.59.desc: "Terrible news reach us from the Trident River, where a number tax barges, carrying a substantial amount of the taxes for $YEAR$, has sunk during a particularly nasty bout of bad weather. The Master of Coin interprets these events as a sign that our dynasty no longer enjoys royal authority, and argues that we must accept and respect this turn of providence. How shall we respond to these ill tidings?"
 GOT_SK_RANDOM.59.option.a: "Sigh. Not much to do, is there?"

 GOT_SK_RANDOM.60.desc: "Provinces have reported to the capital that they are now in full compliance with several sets of new royal edicts, the only problem is that you've never issued any such edicts. An investigation into the matter reveals that forged bronze plaques with written edicts, bearing your seal, have somehow found their way to the local lords. It is a dark time when people dare challenge the King openly, and many claim that this is because our dynasty no longer enjoys royal authority. What shall we do about these false edicts?"
